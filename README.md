# Code Clone Detection System

A **Code Clone Detection System** designed to identify duplicated or highly similar code segments across source files.  
This project demonstrates practical application of **software engineering concepts, program analysis, and similarity detection**, making it suitable for academic evaluation and recruiter review.

---

## 🔍 Overview
Code duplication is a common issue in software projects that increases maintenance cost and introduces hidden bugs.  
This system automatically analyzes source code files and detects **exact and near-duplicate code clones**, helping improve code quality and detect plagiarism.

---

## ✨ Key Highlights
- Detects **exact and near-miss code clones**
- Handles multiple source files efficiently
- Language-independent design (easily extendable)
- Lightweight and scalable approach
- Practical use case in **plagiarism detection & code review**

## 🧠 Approach
1. Source code ingestion  
2. Preprocessing (normalization & cleanup)  
3. Tokenization / line-based analysis  
4. Similarity computation  
5. Clone classification and reporting
